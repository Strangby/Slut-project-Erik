      value: "jkajbkajbs\n\nYear 1924\r\n\r\nThe day has finally arrived, election
        day.\r\n\r\nThe election season has been a very heated event due to the forming
        of many parties that were campaigning to win the first presidential election.\r\n\r\nThe
        4 parties that looked to have the most likely chance to win were:\r\n\r\n<span
        style=\"color:blue\"> The United Party of Empyria </span> (<span style=\"color:blue\">
        UPE </span>) \r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:red\"> The Party of Socialist Empyria
        </span> (<span style=\"color:red\"> PSE </span>) \r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:yellow\">
        The Democratic Peoples Party </span> (<span style=\"color:yellow\"> DPP </span>)
        \r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:brown\"> The Party of Empyrian Nationalists </span>
        (<span style=\"color:brown\"> PEN </span>) \r\n\r\nThe other parties in the
        election were minor parties that noone thought would get past the voting
        limit of 5 percent that general Rudolf set on this election.\r\n\r\nThe <span
        style=\"color:blue\"> UPE </span> is a party that belives in a leader that
        had the necessary power to lead the country while still having to listen
        to the peoples will and the upcoming assembly, their policies are that the
        country has to increase the spending on education in order to improve the
        peoples lifes.\r\n\r\nThe <span style=\"color:red\"> PSE </span> is a party
        that belives in socialism and that the country should be run in a state controlled
        way and that the middle and lower classes should be enriched while the high
        class should be heavely taxed to make sure of a steady income.\r\n\r\nThe
        <span style=\"color:yellow\"> DPP </span> is a party that belives that the
        president should hold minimum power and that the running of the country should
        be left to the upcoming assembly and supreme court, also that the economy
        should be private owned for the most part.\r\n\r\nThe <span style=\"color:brown\">
        PEN </span> is a party that belives in that Empyria should belong to empyrians
        only and that other people groups should either be sent out of the country
        or be integrated to become empyrians, they also belive in that the president
        should have almost dictatorial powers in order to effectively run the country.\r\n\r\nThere
        were many issues that were discussed but the main 3 issues that were talked
        about was:\r\n\r\nThe fate of the king and his family.\r\n\r\nThe new constitution.\r\n\r\nThe
        economy.\r\n\r\nThe different parties gave speeches around the country on
        their positions on the matters and informed where they stood.\r\n\r\nOn the
        matter of the king and his family the <span style=\"color:blue\"> UPE </span>
        has said that we should have a system resembling our neighboring country
        of Sallaran where they have a president and a monarch who is mostly a figurehead.\r\n\r\nThe
        <span style=\"color:red\"> PSE </span> has said that we should have the king
        and his family exiled from the country and move on from the monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe
        <span style=\"color:yellow\"> DPP </span> has said that we should have them
        released and give them the choice to be made citizens of Empyria while taking
        away their titles or for them to leave the country and go somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThe
        <span style=\"color:brown\"> PEN </span> has said that we should have them
        executed and move on from the monarchy.\r\n\r\nOn the matter of the constitution
        the <span style=\"color:blue\"> UPE </span> has said that we should have
        a constitution that gives the president enough power to effectively run the
        country while still making them bound to the assemblys will, while the supreme
        court should have the power to remove the president incase of any illigal
        activities and have the final say on any laws that pass the assembly.\r\n\r\nThe
        <span style=\"color:red\"> PSE </span> has said that the constitution should
        give the president only the necessary authority to run the country and that
        the assembly should hold alot of power in law making while the supreme court
        should have the final say on new laws that are proposed in the assembly by
        the president or a member of assembly.\r\n\r\nThe <span style=\"color:yellow\">
        DPP </span> has said that the constitution should make the assembly the lawmakers
        of the country and that the president handles the other areas of the country
        like the economy and the other areas of governing while the supreme court
        makes sure that all laws passed by the assembly must be lawful acording to
        the constitution.\r\n\r\nThe <span style=\"color:brown\"> PEN </span> has
        said that the constitution should give the president most of the powers of
        the country and the assembly should only be an advisory body to the president
        while the supreme court can be bypassed by presidential decree if the president
        feels the need to intervene against the supreme courts rulings.\r\n\r\nThe
        final matter being the economy the <span style=\"color:blue\"> UPE </span>
        has said that the country should have a policy of intervention so that the
        economy is half free and half state controlled.\r\n\r\nThe <span style=\"color:red\">
        PSE </span> has said that the countrys economic policy should be a planned
        economy so that the state controls the economy.\r\n\r\nThe <span style=\"color:yellow\">
        DPP </span> has said that the economic policy should be that of Laissez-faire
        so that the state has next to no control of the economy and that privet interests
        have control of the economy.\r\n\r\nThe <span style=\"color:brown\"> PEN
        </span> has said that the economic policy should be planned economy so that
        the state controls the economy.\r\n\r\nThe candidates from the main 4 parties
        are:\r\n\r\nThe 58 year old James Morner is the <span style=\"color:blue\">
        UPE </span> candidate.\r\n\r\nThe 46 year old Rikard Melborne is the <span
        style=\"color:red\"> PSE </span> candidate.\r\n \r\nThe 51 year old Thomas
        Porter is the <span style=\"color:yellow\"> DPP </span> candidate.\r\n\r\nThe
        65 year old Adolf Schmidt is the <span style=\"color:brown\"> PEN </span>
        candidate.\r\n\r\nJames Morner was born in the high class <<if $class is
        3>> like you <</if>> and before the kingdom of Empyria fell was one of the
        kings ministers but when the revolution happened he supported general Rudolf.
        James has shown that he is a charming and intelligent man that is a good
        fit for the presidency.\r\n\r\nRikard Melborne was born low class <<if $class
        is 1>> like you <</if>> and lived as most people at the time, but when the
        revolution happened he was one of the first to start convincing people of
        the low class that socialism was the path for them to get the equality that
        they have wanted for so long. Rikard during the election showed himself to
        be a competent speaker and a friendly guy that the people can follow without
        much problem.\r\n\r\nThomas Porter was born in the middle class <<if $class
        is 2>> like you <</if>> and was a well known small business man that helped
        many people with getting things that people needed for their families. During
        the election Thomas showed himself to be a fiery speaker that could get peoples
        attention and was a guy that had a good following of capable people helping
        him through out the election.\r\n\r\nAdolf Schmidt was born in the middle
        class <<if $class is 2>> like you <</if>> and was a man of some reputation
        since he was arrested for being apart of a group of people that was plotting
        to assassinate the king 4 years before the revolution and was released by
        general Rudolf after the revolution. During the election he showed that he
        was not a very good speaker but he did show that he belived what he stood
        for and that he belived that the other 3 parties are to weak to govern the
        country efficiently.\r\n\r\nNow you must decide on who to vote for, general
        Rudolf has arranged for the method of voting to be cards with the different
        parties on them so depending on what card you pick that party is who you
        vote for and for their candidate.\r\n\r\nSo go ahead and choose a card, any
        card...\r\n\r\n[[The United Party of Empyria (UPE)|UPE vote][$vote1 to 1]]\r\n\r\n[[The
